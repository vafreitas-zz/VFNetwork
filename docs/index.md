# VFNetwork

Welcome to our Page, here you will find everything you need to know about VFNetwork.

## What was it created for?

VFNetwork was built with the need to have an ease of implementation and that can be suitable for all types of architecture including MVVM-C, ViPER, MVC among others. Just importing and configuring your requests.

You don't need any kind of abstraction from the network layer, everything is ready to just be configured and enjoyed without complications :).
